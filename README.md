## Overview and Origin

**Name of company**
* Ivo.AI

**When was the company incorporated?**
* 2021

**Who are the founders of the company?**
* Min-Kyu Jung: Co-founder & Chief Executive Officer *(CEO)*
* Jacob Duligall: Co-founder & Chief Technology Officer *(CTO)*

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
* Min-Kyu is a former lawyer that focused on contract reviews and he came across a lot of pain and frustration. He felt like things could be better. Over several years, he met with thousand of legal professionals and realized most lawyers are desparate for technology solutions to improve their lives and day-to-day responsibilities. He saw and heard first hand how contract review was slowing down mission-critical projects. Which led to Min-Kyu and Jacob developing a comprehensive and accurate AI Contract Review platform, designed to help legal and business teams accelerate time-to-close and unblock contracts from key business processes.

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**
* They have Private Equity and Venture Capitalist firms invested into them: Daniel Gross, GD1, and Phase One Ventures. They had two rounds of funding: Pre-Seed & Seed Rounds. They received 1.4 million for their Pre-Seed Round and 4.8 million for their Seed Round totaling 6.2 million dollars in funding to date *(09/20/24)*. 

## Business Activities

**What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
* The pain and challenges companies or legal teams have when it comes to contract review. Through Ivo's Generative AI solution, legal teams are able to review complex contracts more efficiently, reduce overall risk and deliver faster business value. For example, legal teams are able to automate a lot of the document reviews, redlining, explanations and suggestions. Larger LLMs (Language Learning Model) like ChatGPT are not well received or trusted by lawyers which is why Ivo was created specifically to support legal teams around contract or document reviews. 

**Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
* Companies or Businesses that have a lot of contracts and documentations that their legal team has to review. I couldn't find anything that directly states the market size and potential for Ivo's set of customers but I would assume they would be going after mid-market and enterprise companies. There is about 200,000 companies in the United States alone, and they are a global company, so I believe their market size is at least in the seven digit range.  

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
* A lot of Ivo's competitors offers Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) solutions vs a point-solution that Ivo offers. So while there are some advantages a CLM solution provides because it focuses on the whole contract lifecycle, because Ivo directly focuses on the contract review aspect of the lifecylce, Ivo's automations, accuracy, and capabailities will be much better than their CLM solution competitors. One of Ivo's main competitors is Spellbook.legal, which has a platform and solution that is most comparable to Ivo's. Ivo's biggest advantages are they have more native integrations their customers can utilize and integrate directly with other tools and softwares, like Salesforce, they might be using. Also, Ivo is more customizable for their customers to utilize Ivo's AI tool to their direct needs relevant to their specific use case. 

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**
**Here is their current tech stack:**
* **Accord Software, Inc.**: For marketing and sales insights to increase engagament and conversion rates. 
* **Clearbit**: Marketing insights around website activity. Being able to understand the different companies or individuals that might be on the website so they can target and understand the personas that are interested in what they might have to offer. 
* **HubSpot**: Their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution. Where they keep all their potential, active, and past customers data like their contact information, birthday, etc. 
* **Segment**: Their Customer Data Platform (CDP) solution, which has AI capabilities, and where they are able to get clean, consented customer data for real-time insights so they can understand each individual and further improve their product. 
* **reCAPTCHA**: Google's security solution. That helps protect their website from fraudalent activity like scraping, credential stuffing, and automated account creations. 

## Landscape

**What field is the company in?**
* Business *(legal teams)*
* SaaS *(Generative AI)*

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?**
* There have been a lot of different trends and innovations in the business landscape over the last 5 to 10 years. Many of the trends and innovations came from different types of SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platforms and solutions. 
* In January 2024, Forbes stated in an article, that the landscape of generative AI is expected to rapidly evolve by introducing a number of trends that will further transform technology. For example, the advancements we have seen in large language models. The capabilities go beyond text with AI models, where the focus is combining data, such as images, text, and speech, with advanced algorithms to make predictions and generate outcomes. Also the developement of autonomous agents when constructing generative AI models has been significant. Autonomous agents are automated software programs designed to accomplish a specific objective or task.
* To provide a bit more insight on the huge rise of Generative AI, the forecasted reach for market size in 2024 is almost 67 million dollars and is projected to grow at an annual rate of about 21 percent. At the end of 2022 and in 2023, Generative AI exploded into the market because it was like having compentent robot helpers. Using Generative AI, users are able to generate content, creating graphics and videos, and even business presentations. Within a year, we can already see the huge uptick in trends and companies around Generative AI and even the innovations plus improvements that are made seems like on a daily basis. 

**What are the other major companies in this field?**
* OpenAI (ChatGPT)
* Mistral AI
* Meta's Llama 2
* Spellbook.legal
* Powerlaw AI
* Apollo.io

## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
* The business impact has been good overall. Receiving 6.2 million dollars in funding in about three years shows that they have had some significant impact with their space and customers. The business impact they're making is helping companies streamline, automate and improve in both the speed and quality of contract reviews by providing a tool that optimizes legal workflow efficiency. For example, reviewing NDA's can take less than half the time it normally took without using a tool like Ivo. By automating routine contract reviews, a company's legal team can now dedicate more attention and time to strategic initiatives, supporting business growth more effectively. Ivo co-founder and CEO Min-Kyu Jung stated "Contracts are foundational to commerce, but reviewing contracts is a key bottleneck for important business processes. By using AI to reduce the time, effort, and cost of negotiating contracts, we're making it easier for businesses to work together." 
**Here are some customer quotes**: 
* > **Formlabs**: "I'm more confident knowing that I'm not overlooking anything crucial within the contract (by utilizing Ivo). Especially considering the complexity of the contracts I review, where each requires a thorough manual examination."
* > **Quora**: "It's beneficial that I can utilize Ivo, which highlights the critical elements for us, and allow our team to concentrate on more intricate matters without being preoccupied with lower-risk items."
* > **McCollister's**: "It's essentially the first tool I use when I receive a new contract to get some initial redlines out of the way. I also use it to amend terms and to find things within contract while reviewing or after the fact."

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?**
* I believe the core metrics Ivo uses to measure success is how much time they're saving companies' legal teams compared to the time it takes without using Ivo to review a contract or document. Their customers are able to measure their Return On Investment (ROI) by seeing how much time it saves their legal team and how they can dedicate that saved time to other tasks and projects. By saving time by making a time-consuming process much more efficient, they are able to add more responsibilities to the team hence increasing the overall business process which will have a direct impact to their revenue numbers.
**Here are some customer quotes:**
* > **Formlabs**: "Ivo has reduced the time it takes me to review contracts by 50%."
* > **Geotab**: "We saved an average of 45 minutes of review time per contract, which translated into a 75% overall effiency gain."
* > **Quora**: "Ivo will help us better allocate our resources to allow the team to focus on complex and higher risk matters outside of contract review, and in turn better support business initiatives and growth."

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?**
* They are doing well when we compare them with their competitors. Because they have received a significant amount of funding in about three years. They also seem to provide better support and overall better customer service when it comes to implementing Ivo into their workflow along with providing learnings like webinars and trainings. There's not much about their pricing but it seems like based on their customers' case studies, the pricing combined with their solutions and customer support has been very positive and better received vs their competitors. 
**Here are some customer quotes:**
* > **Formlabs**: "It quickly became apparent that Ivo offered the best customer service (compared to its competitors), a fact that has consistently proven true. Essentially, every time an issue has arisen, the team has gone above and beyond to resolve it for us, which has been truly outstanding." 
* > **Quora**: "When I've shared feedback with the Ivo team, I can see that it's clearly being taken into consideration. Even during the evaluation phase, we felt that the Ivo team had a strong focus on continous improvement."
* > **McCollister's**: "Ivo is a remarkable tool if used correctly. It's akin to having a first-year law student or paralegal, where oversight is crucial, but it significantly reduces the workload."
* > **McCollister's**: "The value of Ivo, coupled with its price point, was precisely what we were searching for." 

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
* My suggestion would be to add more integrations that their customers can utilize to make sure the workflow between their tech stacks are seamless. Ivo already has more native integrations that they offer vs their direct competitors, like Spellbook, but I believe the more options the more potential customers they will get. Because in my experience every company has a different tech stack in some shape or form.
* Another suggestion I would have is for something several years down the road. Which is expanding their solutions so they can support and manage the whole contract lifecycle. Some of their competitors are a Contract Lifecycle Management solutions where they help manage every expect of a contract's lifecycle. 

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
* Because when companies and potential customers are looking for a solution, even specifically around contract reviews, they will find a solution that covers that part but also offers support around other aspects of a contract's lifecylce such as managing customers, vendors, partners and includes contract creation, management, sharing and archiving.
* Integrations are crucial when it comes to potential buyers because most companies now are using several different softwares and having a diverse portolio within their tech stack. And integrations saves a ton of time when setting up workflow along with managing it. To be exact: software integration allows different systems, applications, and data sources to connect. 

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
* **API development and management tools**: having tools for API testing and API documentation woud streamline the development of APIs that integrate Ivo's functionalities into various business's tech stack. 
* **Enterprise Integration Platforms**: Platforms like Dell Boomi or MuleSoft could help facilitate the integration of Ivo with large enterprise companies and systems. 
* **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**: Platforms like Oracle could provide backend support of a full contract lifecycle management solution. 
* **Blockchain**: for contract verication and security. It would be able to provide unchangeable record of contract modifications and approvals. 

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
* I believe these technologies are approriate to my solution because it would make Ivo more adaptable and flexible to various business environments, increasing its appeal to companies with a diverse and complex tech stack. Also, it is appropriate for expanding into a CLM solution because they provide the necessary capabilities and scalability as they will be able to support a bigger market size. I believe this strategic expansion could position Ivo as a more comprehensive solution provider and potentially increase customer loyalty.
